            <p>This website is a work in progress, and is to allow people to view the data that is being generated from the Civ Battle Royale. For a look at the the community that has inspired this site, you can follow the link to the Reddit site, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/">Civ Battle Royale</a>.</p>
            <p>The Charts: They have been updated to select multiple Civs at anyone time, and a legend showing the colour of each civ displayed. There will be more features added in the future to enhance the charts</p>
            <p>The Data Table: Once you click the button "Display Table", the site will load the data from the server and process into a table. As this is a very large file, and is growing with each part it will take a while to load and display. Please be patient.</p>
            <p>Import InfoAddict Data: This allows you to copy and paste the data from the raw InfoAddict data file, and it will then be processed into a CSV that can be downloaded to your computer to allow for analysis.</p>
            <p>If you wish to download the Info Addict Data file, you can download the file with the following link. <a href="data/CBR.Data.csv">Info Addict Data Turn 1 - 508</a></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Any feedback you wish to give about what has been done, or any suggestions or improvements, please message me on reddit. My username is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/">Be1eriand</a>. One of my other aims is to let you download the CSV to your computer is you so wish, along with being able to process the InfoAddict data into a form that can be handled by this site and spreadsheets.</p>
